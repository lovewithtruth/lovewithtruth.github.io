God is not "a son of man, that he should change his mind".

 - Numbers 23:19
 - 1 Samuel 15:29
 - Psalm 89:34
 - Hebrews 7:21

But when the people that God created do wickedly, it grieves the Holy Spirit, and God expresses "regret":

 - Genesis 6:5-8
 - 1 Samuel 15:10-11, 35
 - Ephesians 4:30
 - Isaiah 63:10

God promises judgement against the wicked (if they continue in their wickedness). God relents when they repent:

 - Jeremiah 26:1-19 esp. Jer 26:3, 13, 19
 - Israel's watchman: Ezekiel 33:1-20
 - Jonah 3,4 esp. Jonah 3:10: "When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God relented of the disaster that he had said that he would do to them, and he did not do it."
 - Mercy triumphs over judgment: James 2:13

God promises judgement against the wicked, but is patient for the sake of his name and for one who will stand in the gap:

 - Psalm 106:7-8
 - Golden calf incident: Exodus 32:7-14 esp. Ex 32:14, Psalm 106:23
 - Abraham pleads with God on behalf of any righteous remaining in Sodom. God destroys the city, but, remembering Abraham, spares Lot and his daughters: Genesis 18:17-33, Gen 19:29
