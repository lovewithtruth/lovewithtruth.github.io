> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
> Genesis 1:1 

## &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t God have used a Big Bang?&#8221;

In verse 2, he makes it clear that the earth started with water, not rocks that collided after an explosion and were to hot for water.
> The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
> Genesis 1:2 

## &#8220;Did God really say it took him only 6 days?&#8221;

God makes it clear, not just in Genesis, that He created &#8220;the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them&#8221; in 6 days:
> For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
> Exodus 20:11 

He makes the abruptness of His creation very clear:

> And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
> Genesis 1:3 

&#8230;and in six other places He follows His &#8220;let there be&#8221;, &#8220;let the [earth/waters]&#8221;, and &#8220;let Us make&#8221; commands with an &#8220;and it was so&#8221;. Then, in Genesis 2 He says:

> Thus the heavens and the earth were **finished**, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God **finished** his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.
> Genesis 2:1-2 [emphasis mine] 

## &#8220;He was probably just being poetic.&#8221;

  * We&#8217;re Genesis and Exodus both poetry? God mentions how quick of a worker he is in both: Gen 2:1-3, Ex 20:11
  * Was Jesus just being poetic when, while talking with some Pharisees about divorce, he quoted Genesis 5:2 saying, &#8220;from the **beginning** of creation, God made them male and female.&#8221; [emphasis mine]: Matt 19:4, Mark 10:6

## &#8220;He couldn&#8217;t have meant actual days.&#8221;

In Genesis 1:5 He calls the light day, and the darkness night as precedent for our modern understanding of a day. Then, in the same verse, he says, &#8220;there was evening and there was morning, one day&#8221;. Obviously referring to a literal ~24hr day. He then follows every other day of creation with &#8220;And there was evening and there was morning, a [second-sixth] day&#8221;.

> And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
> Genesis 1:4-5 

## Conclusion

> Every word of God proves true;
> he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
> Do not add to his words,
> lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar.
> Proverbs 30:5-6
