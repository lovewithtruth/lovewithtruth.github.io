title: Cure for the Calvinist Cancer
---
These are notes taken plus some of my own thoughs while listening to [Cure for the Calvinist Cancer](http://www.thefaithoncedelivered.info/web-living_faith_g00001d.mp3): my thanks to [Living Faith Christian Fellowship](http://www.thefaithoncedelivered.info/). Emphases in scripture quotations are always mine.

A god who, purely of his own will, predestines only a select few to eternal life and the rest to eternal punishment is showing partiality and being a "respecter of persons". This is not the LORD our God:

> For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe.
> 
> Deut 10:17

The Calvinist says that their supposed predestination to eternal punishment is due to God choosing not to regenerate them and denying them the ability to repent. Such partiality would be deceitful seeing as God "commands all people everywhere to repent" (Acts 17:30).

 - God is no respecter of persons
	 - Deut 10:17 "For the LORD your God... is not partial and takes no bribe"
	 - 2 Chr 19:7 "...for there is no injustice with the LORD our God, or partiality or taking bribes."
	 - Acts 10:34-35 "...God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him."
	 - Gal 2:6 "...God shows no partiality..."
	 - Eph 6:9 "...he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him."
	 - Col 3:23-25 "...the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality."
	 - 1 Peter 1:17
	 - Romans 2:5-11
		 - Ro 2:6 "He will render to each one according to his works:"
		 - Ro 2:11 "For God shows no partiality."
	 - Rev 22:12 "Behold, I am coming soon... to repay each one for what he has done."

 - Man must not be a respecter of persons either
	 - 1 Tim 5:21 "...keep these rules without prejudging, doing nothing from partiality."
	 - James 2:1,4,9
		 - "...show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ..."
		 - "have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?"
		 - "But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors."
	 - James 3:17 "But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere."

 - Consider the parable of the sower:
	 - God shows no partiality: they all were given the true Word of God: Luke 8:11-12
	 - Luke 8:13 some "believe for a while, and in time of testing fall away."
		 - Heb 3:12 "Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God."
		 - Matt 24:13 "But the one who perseveres to the end will be saved."
		 - John 3:16 "whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life"
		 - When someone falls away it is not because God didn't offer them the same grace or that God predestined them to be slaves of sin.
			 - Titus 2:11 "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people"
			 - James 1:13-17 "...God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone."

 - Consider the lineage of Jesus:
	 - Abraham sought God and He and his posterity had extra privileges: namely being in the line of the messiah
		 - every Gentile still had opportunity to come to God for salvation (Ruth, the Moabitess) and no Jew was automatically ensured salvation
	 - Isaac chosen, Ishmael not; Jacob chosen, Esau not 
		 - didn't mean salvation for their children
	 - A privileged group is dealt with as a group and does not affect the salvation of individuals in the group.

 - God deals with nations in a similar fashion as he deals with individuals. The difference: every person is still accountable for their own salvation
	 - Jeremiah 18:1-12
		 - Jer 18:3-4 "Then I went down to the potter’s house, and there he was, making something on the wheel. But the vessel that he was making of clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter; so he remade it into another vessel, as it pleased the potter to make."
		 - Jer 18:6 "Can I not, O **house of Israel**, deal with you as this potter does?” declares the Lord. “Behold, like the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel."
			 - This is **speaking of a people group, not individuals**.
		 - Jer 18:7-8 "...if that **nation** against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent concerning the calamity I planned to bring on it."
		 - Jer 18:9-10 "...if it does evil in My sight by not obeying My voice, then I will think better of the good with which I had promised to bless it."
		 - When a nation obeys the voice of the LORD it prospers (Jer 7:23) being a vessel with his favor. When that nation does evil, God remakes it into a vessel of His wrath.
	 - Romans 9 deals with people groups not individuals.
		 - Heads of people groups: Isaac, Esau, Jacob, Pharaoh
		 - Rom 9:12 quotes from Gen 25:23 "**Two nations** are in your womb,
and **two peoples** from within you shall be divided;
the one shall be stronger than the other,
**the older shall serve the younger**."
			 - This is talking about their descendants, i.e. people groups not individuals. Jacob himself, in his lifetime, was not a servant of Esau. In fact, Jacob called Esau, "My lord" and refers to himself as Esau's servant (Gen 32:4).
		 - Rom 9:13 quotes from Malachi 1:1-3 "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."
			 - Mal 1:1-2 "The oracle of the word of the LORD **to Israel** by Malachi. 'I have loved you,' says the LORD. ..."
				 - In this context the LORD is speaking of a nation whom He loves not an individual.
			 - Mal 1:3 refers to the nation of Edom by the name of its founder Esau. This is shown by the reference to Edom in Mal 1:4 as being the same entity.
	 - Revelation 19:7-9 God has predestined for himself a spotless bride.
	 - Ephesians 1 is speaking of those in Christ as a whole saying that "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world" and "predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself".
	 - Acts 17:26-27:  For every nation of mankind, God determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, that they should seek God, and **perhaps** [not predestination] feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us
