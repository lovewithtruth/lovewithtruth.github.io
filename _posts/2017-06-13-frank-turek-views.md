Scripture quotations are from the NASB. Frank Turek quotes are taken from the first hour of his debate with Christopher Hitchens: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7WBEJJlYWU" rel="nofollow">Does God exist?</a>

## Can atheists be moral?

#### Frank Turek
> I’m not saying that atheists can’t be moral, they can.

#### Psalm 14: For the choir director. _A Psalm_ of David.
> <sup><b>1</b></sup>The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”  
> They are corrupt, they have committed abominable deeds;  
> There is no one who does good.  
> <sup><b>2</b></sup>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men  
> To see if there are any who understand,  
> Who seek after God.  
> <sup><b>3</b></sup>They have all turned aside, together they have become corrupt;  
> There is no one who does good, not even one.

> <sup><b>4</b></sup>Do all the workers of wickedness not know,  
> Who eat up my people _as_ they eat bread,  
> _And_ do not call upon the Lord?  
> <sup><b>5</b></sup>There they are in great dread,  
> For God is with the righteous generation.  
> <sup><b>6</b></sup>You would put to shame the counsel of the afflicted,  
> But the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is his refuge.

> <sup><b>7</b></sup>Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!  
> When the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> restores His captive people,  
> Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad.


## Is Christ's body (the church) all sinners?

#### Frank Turek
> Religious people have done awful things. In fact, Christianity predicts we'll be hypocrites. That's what the Church is — it's full of hypocrites. Whenever somebody says, "I don't want to go to church — there are too many hypocrites down there," I always say, "come on down pal. We got room for one more." That's what the Church is: we're all fallen, we're all sinners — that's why we need a savior (because we can't do it).


#### Galatians 2
> <sup><b>15</b></sup>“We _are_ Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; <sup><b>16</b></sup>nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified. <sup><b>17</b></sup>But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? May it never be! <sup><b>18</b></sup>For if I rebuild what I have _once_ destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor. <sup><b>19</b></sup>For through the Law I died to the Law, so that I might live to God. <sup><b>20</b></sup>I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the _life_ which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me. <sup><b>21</b></sup>I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness _comes_ through the Law, then Christ died needlessly.”


## When did God create life?

#### Frank Turek
> I think it’s obvious there’s a theistic God because life came several billion years after the creation. That is not a deistic concept, that is a theistic concept.

#### Mark 10
> <sup><b>6</b></sup>But from the beginning of creation, _God_ <span class="small-caps">made them male and female</span>.

#### Genesis 1
> <sup><b>20</b></sup>Then God said, “Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens.” <sup><b>21</b></sup>God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind; and God saw that it was good. <sup><b>22</b></sup>God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” <sup><b>23</b></sup>There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.

> <sup><b>24</b></sup>Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind”; and it was so. <sup><b>25</b></sup>God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.

> <sup><b>26</b></sup>Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” <sup><b>27</b></sup>God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. <sup><b>28</b></sup>God blessed them; and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” <sup><b>29</b></sup>Then God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you; <sup><b>30</b></sup>and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to every thing that moves on the earth which has life, _I have given_ every green plant for food”; and it was so. <sup><b>31</b></sup>God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

## Conclusion

We must be careful in our speech to speak the truth, and we must be careful in our listening to discern the truth. God's Word is truth.

#### 1 Corinthians 1
> <sup><b>20</b></sup>Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? <sup><b>21</sup>b></sup>For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not _come to_ know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe. <sup><b>22</sup>b></sup>For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom; <sup><b>23</sup>b></sup>but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness, <sup><b>24</sup>b></sup>but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. <sup><b>25</sup>b></sup>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
