  * **Hello, Hello, It’s me again, It’s me again**: Who are we elevating in worship (or pointing at with motions) ourselves or God?: Matt 16:24
  * **I know, I know, When I call You hear me, You hear me** 
      * As I understand scripture, the statement, &#8220;When I call You hear me&#8221; won’t be true for singers that are wicked sinners (as I was apart from Christ), but only for those that through Christ are made righteous: Ps 34:15-18, Prov 15:29, Prov 28:9, 1 Tim 2:5. The statement then, is true for those who are worshipers of God and do his will (Jn 9:31), but from these lines and the next it&#8217;s clear that the singer is not saying &#8220;your will be done on earth as it is in heaven&#8221; but &#8220;You hear [**me** and **what I&#8217;ve got to say**]&#8221;
  * **I love, I love to pray ‘cause You hear what I’ve got to say**: This line has the same issue as the last. It also makes a statement about the singer&#8217;s feelings (&#8220;I love to pray&#8221;). Feelings change, so for some, these words would likely be void of truth (Jn 4:24, Mt 12:36). Why not sing of God&#8217;s steadfast love that endures forever (1 Jn 4:10, Ps 136)? His praise endures forever (Ps 111:10)! Feelings don&#8217;t (1 Jn 2:15-17).

The next 3 lines may be based on Luke 6:46-49, but much liberty is taken with the paraphrase. The Luke 6 passage is an expression of **God&#8217;s will**: &#8220;Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do what I tell you?&#8221; (v. 46). This agrees with the pattern of worship expressed throughout the scriptures (Rom 12:1-2, Is 55:8-9). These lines, however, are statements about what **we** want and will to do.

  * **But I never wanna be someone who just talks and never listens to You**
  * **I wanna be the one who says that I’ll follow (oooh oooh!)**
  * **I’m gonna follow You**

Last 2 lines:

  * **Everyday God nothing, no nothing will ever separate me from Your love today God**: God is love! Rom 5:6-11, Rom 8:35-39
  * **nothing, no nothing will ever stop me from living for You**: Again, sadly, this won&#8217;t be true for all singers (Matt 15:7-9, 1 Cor 15:1-2), so having this statement without qualifying who the &#8220;I&#8221; is to whom it applies is dangerous.

True worship is not about us, how we feel, what we love, or what we want to do, but about continually offering up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name (Heb 13:15).

> Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth!
> Serve the Lord with gladness!
> Come into his presence with singing!
> Know that the Lord, he is God!
> It is he who made us, and we are his;
> we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
> Enter his gates with thanksgiving,
> and his courts with praise!
> Give thanks to him; bless his name!
> For the Lord is good;
> his steadfast love endures forever,
> and his faithfulness to all generations.
> 
> **Psalm 100**
