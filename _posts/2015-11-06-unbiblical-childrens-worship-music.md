  * **Hello, Hello, It’s me again, It’s me again**: Who are we elevating in worship (or pointing at with motions) ourselves or God?: Matt 16:24
  * **I know, I know, When I call You hear me, You hear me** 
      * As I understand scripture, the statement, "When I call You hear me" won’t be true for singers that are wicked sinners (as I was apart from Christ), but only for those that through Christ are made righteous: Ps 34:15-18, Prov 15:29, Prov 28:9, 1 Tim 2:5. The statement then, is true for those who are worshipers of God and do his will (Jn 9:31), but from these lines and the next it's clear that the singer is not saying "your will be done on earth as it is in heaven" but "You hear [**me** and **what I've got to say**]"
  * **I love, I love to pray ‘cause You hear what I’ve got to say**: This line has the same issue as the last. It also makes a statement about the singer's feelings ("I love to pray"). Feelings change, so for some, these words would likely be void of truth (Jn 4:24, Mt 12:36). Why not sing of God's steadfast love that endures forever (1 Jn 4:10, Ps 136)? His praise endures forever (Ps 111:10)! Feelings don't (1 Jn 2:15-17).

The next 3 lines may be based on Luke 6:46-49, but much liberty is taken with the paraphrase. The Luke 6 passage is an expression of **God's will**: "Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do what I tell you?" (v. 46). This agrees with the pattern of worship expressed throughout the scriptures (Rom 12:1-2, Is 55:8-9). These lines, however, are statements about what **we** want and will to do.

  * **But I never wanna be someone who just talks and never listens to You**
  * **I wanna be the one who says that I’ll follow (oooh oooh!)**
  * **I’m gonna follow You**

Last 2 lines:

  * **Everyday God nothing, no nothing will ever separate me from Your love today God**: God is love! Rom 5:6-11, Rom 8:35-39
  * **nothing, no nothing will ever stop me from living for You**: Again, sadly, this won't be true for all singers (Matt 15:7-9, 1 Cor 15:1-2), so having this statement without qualifying who the "I" is to whom it applies is dangerous.

True worship is not about us, how we feel, what we love, or what we want to do, but about continually offering up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name (Heb 13:15).

> Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth!
> Serve the Lord with gladness!
> Come into his presence with singing!
> Know that the Lord, he is God!
> It is he who made us, and we are his;
> we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
> Enter his gates with thanksgiving,
> and his courts with praise!
> Give thanks to him; bless his name!
> For the Lord is good;
> his steadfast love endures forever,
> and his faithfulness to all generations.
> 
> Psalm 100
