> If the Law was nailed to the cross and sin is the violation of the Law then there is no more sin so why do I need a saviour?

The passage of scripture in question here is from Colossians 2:

> <sup>**6 **</sup>Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, _so_ walk in Him...
> 
> <sup>**13 **</sup>When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions, <sup>**14 **</sup>having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.

This does not say that the Law was nailed to the cross, but only the sin debt of those who receive Jesus as Messiah. That debt is the price that must be paid for sin including the curses for disobedience found in Deuteronomy 27 and 28. Jesus and his followers always upheld the law as righteous (Matt 5:17-20, Romans 3:31, 7:12). This is true even though it effects a curse upon all of humanity because of their falling short. 

> The LORD has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men  
> To see if there are any who understand,  
> Who seek after God.  
> They have all turned aside, together they have become corrupt;  
> There is no one who does good, not even one.
> 
> Psalm 14:2-3

The Law, clearly then, will justify no one. But, from the beginning it has been that "the righteous will live by his faith" (Habakkuk 2:4). Abraham, for example, "believed in the LORD," and the LORD "reckoned it to him as righteousness" (Genesis 15:6). Those who would like to receive that same righteousness must follow in the footsteps of Abraham's faith, just as the Lord said to him, "in you all the families of the earth will be blessed” (Gen 12:3). This promise ("in you all the families of the earth will be blessed”), God later clarified saying, "In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice” (Gen 22:18). Two things can be learned about God's blessing of righteousness from this clarification:

1. It only comes to those who have obedience accompanying their faith.
2. It would come through a descendant ("seed") of Abraham.

The seed is Jesus. He is the fulfillment of this and all other prophecies about the messiah in the Hebrew Scriptures.

Don't be deceived by those who reject God's Son and our only Redeemer:

> He is the <span class="small-caps">stone which was rejected</span> by you, <span class="small-caps">the builders</span>, _but_ <span class="small-caps">which became the chief corner</span> _stone_. And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved.”
