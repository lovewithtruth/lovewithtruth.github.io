> Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.<br/>
> James 5:16 

We are worshiping in spirit, as true worshipers do (John 4:23-24) only when we are presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God (Romans 12:1-2).

We can offer our bodies as a living sacrifice, but for the sacrifice to be holy and acceptable to God, we need to keep the words of Jesus in Matthew 5:23-24: &#8220;So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.&#8221;

> Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.<br/>
> Proverbs 28:13

> But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<br/>
> 2 Corinthians 12:9
