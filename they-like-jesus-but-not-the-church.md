#### The world hates the true Jesus
John 7:7
> The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil.

**In, but not of, the world:**
John 17:15-16, 1 Cor 5:9-10, James 1:29

#### Sinners will not stand in the assembly of the righteous
Psalm 1:5
> Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

1 Cor 14:23-25
> Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and ungifted men or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad? 24 But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, **he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all**; 25 the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so he will fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is certainly among you.

Convicted is also translated "show him his fault" in Mt 18:15

#### Jesus more respected now?
Kimball tells of his time speaking to a group of pastors at an evangelism conference [p. II-I2]:

> I painted an optimistic picture of the exciting times we live in, when Jesus is becoming more and more respected in our culture by non-churchgoing people.

Is Jesus becoming more and more respected in our culture? I would have to say no. Jesus repeats over and over in John 14 that if we love Him we will keep His commandments. What I see is wholesale abandonment of godly morals, and "Because lawlessness is increased, most people’s love will grow cold."

#### Jesus doesn't speak on the role of women in the church?
In the last paragraph on page 54 Kimball says this:

> On the other end of the Christian spectrum, the more extreme fundamentalist camp has made Jesus out to be an angry avenging figure. Instead of having compassion for sinners, he has only anger and points his finger at their sins to condemn them. **This Jesus** probably votes only for one political party and **has strong opinions on all types of things outside of what he said in the Bible, including on the role of women in the church, what type of music to listen to, and which Bible version to use**.

With this statement Kimball says that Jesus has not spoken in his Word about the role of women in the church. Jesus has spoken very clearly and repeatedly on this through the writings of His apostles. The apostles writings are, in fact, the Word of God given them as they were moved by the Spirit of Christ.

By this characterization Kimball also criticizes the use of proper discernment based on the principles established in God's Word. Christians must certainly exercise discernment when it comes to what type of music to listen to and what Bible version to use.

#### Jesus stood against religious legalism?
On Pg. 56 Kimball shows how he thinks of Jesus. He says, "I think of the one who stood strong against the religious legalism of his day (Luke 20:19-20)." Jesus certainly did not come against strict adherence to the law of moses. This would have been a good thing. He came against religious hypocrisy. This is seen in Matthew 23 where he says the following:

> The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses; therefore all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds; for they say things and do not do them. They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men’s shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger.
